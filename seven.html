    The BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by the German automaker BMW since 1977.[1] It is the successor to the BMW E3 "New Six" sedan and is now in its seventh generation.

    The 7 Series is BMW's flagship car and is only available in a sedan bodystyle (including long wheelbase and limousine models). It traditionally introduces technologies and exterior design themes before other models in BMW's lineup.[2]
    
    The first generation of the 7 Series was powered by straight-6 petrol engines, and following generations have been powered by inline-4, straight-6, V8 and V12 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 1995, diesel engines have been optional in the 7 Series.
    
    Unlike the 3 Series and 5 Series sedans, BMW does not offer a full M model, but once offered an M performance variant, the BMW M760 with its 6.6L V12 (at the time the most powerful BMW ever made, not to be confused with BMW 760 6.6 V12 which does not offer the same performance). The Alpina B7 (G12) served as the high-performance variant of the 7 Series.
</p>

<h2>First generation (E23; 1977)</h2>
<p>The E23 is the first generation 7 Series and was produced from 1977 to 1987. It was built in a 4-door sedan body style with 6-cylinder engines, to replace the E3 sedans. From 1983 to 1987, a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine was available in some markets.

    The E23 introduced many electronic features for the first time in a BMW, including an onboard computer, a service interval indicator, a "check control panel" (warning lights to indicate system faults to the driver), a dictaphone, and complex climate control systems. It was also the first BMW to offer an anti-lock braking system (ABS), a driver's airbag, and double-link front suspension.</p>
<h2>Second generation (E32; 1986)</h2>
<p>The E32 is the second generation of the 7 Series, which was produced from 1986 to 1994. It was initially available with a straight-six or V12 engine, the latter being Germany's first passenger car with a V12 since World War II. In 1992, V8 engines became available.

    The E32 introduced the following features for the first time in a BMW: Electronic Damper Control,[3] V12 and V8 engines, double glazing, the CAN bus electronic protocol,[4] Xenon headlamps,[5] traction control[6] and dual-zone climate control.[7] The E32 750i was the first car adhering to BMW's self-imposed speed limit of 250 km/h (155 mph).[8] The 'iL' models were the first time that a long-wheelbase option was offered by BMW.</p>
<h2>Third generation (E38; 1994)</h2>
<p>The E38 is the third generation of the 7 Series, which was produced from 1994 to 2001. The model range consisted of standard length and long wheelbase ("iL" models) sedans.

    The petrol engines available consisted of straight-six, V8 and V12 engines. The E38 was the first 7 Series to be available with a diesel engine; initially, a turbocharged straight-six, which was joined by a twin-turbocharged V8 in 1999.
    
    The E38 was the first car available with curtain airbags. It was also the first European car to offer satellite navigation[9] and the first BMW to offer an in-built television.
    
    In 1999, the model received a facelift.</p>
<h2>Fourth generation (E39; 1995)</h2>
<p>The E39 is the fourth generation of 5 Series, which was manufactured for model years 1995–2004. It was launched in the sedan body style, with the wagon/estate body style (marketed as "Touring") introduced in 1996.

    The E39 was the first 5 Series to use aluminium components in the front suspension. The proportion of chassis components using aluminium significantly increased for the E39,[7] in order to reduce weight. It was also the first 5 Series where a four-cylinder diesel engine was available.
    
    V8 models used recirculating ball steering (as per previous 5 Series generations), however rack and pinion steering was used for the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.
    
    The E39 M5 sedan was introduced in 1998, powered by the 4.9-litre S62 V8 engine.</p>
<h2>Fifth generation (E60/E61; 2003)</h2>
<p>The E60/E61 is the fifth generation of the 5 Series, which was sold from 2003 to 2010. The body styles of the range are:

    4-door sedan/saloon (E60 model code)
    5-door estate/wagon (E61 model code, marketed as "Touring")
    The E60 generation introduced various electronic features to the 5 Series, including iDrive, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering and voice control. The E60 also was the first 5 Series available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking. New safety features for the E60 included adaptive headlights, night vision, active headrests, Lane Departure Warning, and high intensity emergency brake lights. Unlike the three previous generations of 5 Series[8][9] and the F10 successor,[10] the E60/E61 centre console is not angled towards the driver.
    
    The E60/E61 M5 was released in 2005 and was powered by the S85 V10 engine. It was sold in the sedan and wagon body styles, with most cars using a 7-speed automated manual transmission ("SMG III"). However, in the North American Markets, there was the option to buy the BMW M5 in a manual version.</p>
<h2>Sixth generation (F10/F11/F07/F18; 2010)</h2>
<p>The BMW F10/F11/F07/F18 is the sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was manufactured for model years 2010–2017.[11][12] The body styles of the range are:

    4-door sedan/saloon (F10)
    5-door estate/wagon (F11, marketed as "Touring")
    5-door fastback (F07, marketed as "Gran Turismo")
    4-door long wheelbase sedan (F18, sold only in China and the Middle East)
    The F07 Gran Turismo was the only 5 Series to date produced as a fastback. The F10 was also the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a turbocharged V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, a dual-clutch transmission, active rear-wheel steering (called "Integral Active Steering"), electric power steering, double-wishbone front suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called "Black Panel Display") and automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant").[13]
    
    The F10 M5 was powered by the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. It was the first M5 to use a turbocharged engine. Like the previous generation, the F10 M5, in North America was sold with a manual transmission.[14]</p>
    

<h2>Seventh generation (G30/G31/G38; 2017)</h2>
<p>
    The BMW G30/G31/G38 is the seventh generation of the 5 Series. It was officially announced in October 2016, and sales began in February 2017.[15][16][17]

    Body styles included:
    
    4-door sedan/saloon (G30)
    5-door wagon/estate (G31)
    4-door long-wheelbase saloon (G38)
    The fastback 5 Series GT model from the previous generation is no longer offered, and was moved to the 6 Series range.[18]
    
    The G30 is based on the same modular platform as the 7 Series (G11). The G30 is the first 5 Series to be offered with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, the 530e iPerformance, which would have the advanced driver-assistance systems found in the 7 Series.[19]
    
    The F90 M5 is the M5 performance model for the G30 generation, and is the first M5 to employ an all-wheel drive powertrain. The X-Drive system allowed for the front differential to disconnect and provide a rear-wheel drive experience to the vehicle. It is powered by an upgraded version of the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine used in the previous generation F10 M5.[20] The 5 Series received a face lift in 2020, retaining the same mechanics and engines.
</p>
<h2>Eighth generation (G60/G61/G68; 2024)</h2>
<p>
    The BMW G60/G61/G68 is the eighth generation of the 5 Series. It was revealed on May 24, 2023,[21][22] and will commence production in summer at BMW's Dingolfing Plant in 2023, with first deliveries beginning around October 2023.[23] The fastback 6 Series Gran Turismo model has been discontinued. The 5-series will be offered in 530i, 540i, and 550e trims, with the 530i containing a 255-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, offered with rear or all wheel drive. The 540i is standard with all-wheel drive as well as a 375-hp turbocharged inline-six engine. All variants—excluding the plug-in hybrid variants—feature a 48-volt mild hybrid system; this system consists of a 20 Ah lithium-ion and an electric motor/integrated starter-generator rated at 13 kW (17 hp) and 200 N⋅m (150 lbf⋅ft). The 5 Series is claimed to be powerful enough to hit 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds by BMW.[24]

    The eighth generation BMW 5 Series is also offered with a battery electric powertrain, dubbed the "i5". Three models are offered; the entry-level, rear-wheel-drive eDrive40 model, the mid-range, all-wheel-drive xDrive40, and the range topping M60 xDrive model.
